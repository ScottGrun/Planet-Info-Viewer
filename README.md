## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each planet page and toggle between "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology"

### Extra Challenges I Gave Myself

- 3D model of all planets
- AR model of all planets (IOS only for now)
- Server side rendering

## My process


1. Review the designs and check to see if a grid and design system are provided. If not I will attempt to create my own CSS design system and determine the best grid options.

2. Extract out whatever design system or style guide was provided into a styled components theme.

3. I will go through and create a mobile-only version of the website first and then make my way up the breakpoints untill all required breakpoints are covered.

4. Once the page is complete I will go through and check to see if any margins, padding, font sizes, or the copy is off / different from the designs.

5. After that I will make an accessibility sweep and make sure that that all images have alt text, font colors meet WCAG guidelines, and the appropriate aria labels are added, and that the page tab order makes sense.

6. Add in any micro animations that are part of the design.
